# GameOfLifeProject
This project is a 2D cellular automaton called "Game Of Life" imitation project in which it is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square  cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead, (or populated and  unpopulated, respectively).

Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells 
that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following 
transitions occur:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by 
reproduction.
